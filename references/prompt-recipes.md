# Prompt Recipes

## 1) JD-driven optimization

```text
I will provide my resume and a JD.
Please optimize to a single-page A4 ATS-friendly resume.
Focus on evidence chains and quantifiable impact.
Keep facts unchanged.
```

## 2) General direction resume (no JD)

```text
Based on my resume, generate a general SDE resume.
Focus on AI model engineering productionization + data platform + backend SDE capabilities.
Keep facts unchanged and output JSON cache first.
```

## 3) PDF generation with auto-fit layout only

```text
Generate final PDF from cache/resume-working.json and enable auto-fit.
Auto-fit must tune layout parameters only and must not rewrite resume content.
```
